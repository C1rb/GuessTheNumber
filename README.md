# GuessTheNumber

GuessTheNumber is a simple game I made using Python. 
The main mechanic of the game is to guess the number that randomly generated from the program. 

NOTE:

USE THE VERSION 1.2 FOR THE FULL GAME WITH THE QUITING INTERFACE, ABOUT SECTION AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE SCORING SYSTEM.
IF YOU DIDNT USE VERSION 1.2 YOU WILL ONLY HAVE LIMITED FEAUTURES. SEE VERSION HISTORY BELOW...

VERSIONS: 

Version 1.0
- Basic Game
- Basic text interface

Version 1.1
- Added scoring system
- Improved text interface

Version 1.2
- Added the about section
- Added the quiting interface
- Optimized code

MECHANICS:
The player must guess the number to win the game.

SCORING SYSTEM:
The higher your score the lower your points while the lower your score the higher your points. 

Feel free to use and improve my code.

Cheers,
